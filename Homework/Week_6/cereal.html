  <p>Cerels are a popular type of breakfast all over the world. It is a tasty and crunchy start of the day.
    But this raises the question, is this start of the day also a healthy start.
  To answer this question, I made you some visualiation tools.
  I took 50 well-known cereal brand and gathered their nutritional values per 100 gram.
  By clicking on the bar chart on the prefered ceral brand, you can see a pie chart that will give you more information on the amount of fat,
  proteins and carbohydrates in that specific ceral brand.</p>
